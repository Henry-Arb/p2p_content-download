#TO DO:
- everything
##specifically rn:
- implement dynamic socket creation in registerContent() method in peer.c, then find a way to store those socket descriptors for when they need to be closed later (I am guessing we can save them all in a Linked List)
- implement linked list in index_server for storing content info
